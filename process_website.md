# Process Website

Documentation of your creative process is an integral part of your creative work; it records the many steps in the creation of a work. This is important because process documentation:

*   allows you to review and reflect on the iterative journey of your ideas and their physical manifestations over time
*   can often be the catalyst for future projects that derive from some unexplored thread in the original idea
*   captures previous points in the life of a creative work that you may need to go back to if the chosen direction does not prove successful
*   provides ample material with which to communicate to a public audience the narrative of your work, the evolution of your ideas, and the morphology of materials and forms

With this in mind, throughout the duration of the semester each student must carefully document all of the work created in this class, from brainstorming sessions with post-it notes to pages in a sketchbook to rough prototypes. You will post this documentation on your process website on a daily or weekly basis. 

You have several options:

* Get wordpress installed via sites.bxmc.poly.edu (see below) in a directory labeled **ip**
* If you already have a sites.bxmc.poly.edu account, have Elton install another instance of wordpress in a directory labeled **ip** (see below)
* Alternatively create an **ip** directory if you already have server space of your own via an ISP (Internet Service Provider), and install wordpress in that directory.


Your site _must_ have the following sections that are accessible via a menu or tags: 

- Sketchbook
- Reflections & Responses (ie, written homework)
- Homework (Visual, Graphical assignments)
- Constant Input/Output
- Midterm Project 
- Final Project

### See module 1 for step by step instructions to set up a process site.

### Otherwise: Wordpress Group Registration

If you don’t already have server space, please schedule an appointment with Elton Kwok, IDM's Technology Director, eltonkwok@nyu.edu, MAGNET 883.

Please remember to bring your laptop with you when you visit a session.

If you choose wordpress on bxmc.poly.edu, set up your class website at
  * http://sites.bxmc.poly.edu/~yourfirstnamelastname/ip

Test your site URL first from a different browser. Test the pages or tags to ensure they are working properly.
