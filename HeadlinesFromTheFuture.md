# Headlines From the Future

Imagine a daily newspaper from your future.

What would the stories be that describe:


- What this world is like

- Why is it this way?

- What happened to get the world to the point that point?

- How did we get here?

- What are some mechanics that make this world work?


Moodboard: Collect images and visuals that describe this world.

Then, add these along with your headlines into the Newspaper (Indesign file).
