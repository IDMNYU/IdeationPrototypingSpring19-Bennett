Capture the essence of your product or service with a snappy, beautiful brochure or webpage.


1. Start with paper. Fold it into thirds, or WHATEVER your heart desires.


2. Think about the flow of the information. What's the first, attention-grabbing thing someone should know? Write a catchy brochure title and sketch out an image to go along with it. In the interior, further down the page, or on subsequent pages, write descriptions of the key features of your product or service.


3. Lastly, include a call to action for the brocure user. Should they visit your website? Call a number? Think about what people would want to do next.


4. Get feedback from the group.

5. Iterate and polish this for homework, posting the drawings and the polished iteration to your process site.
