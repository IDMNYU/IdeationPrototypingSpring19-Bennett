# Narrative Timeline of Influences

*Make sure you watch <a href="http://everythingisaremix.info/watch-the-series" target="_blank">Everything Is A Remix</a> before embarking on this assignment.*

As research for your future utopia / dystopia project, create an evolution timeline by making one of the following:

*   an infographic as a pdf (post on your process website) **OR** 
*	a video documentary 1 to 3 minutes in length, post on vimeo or youtube, and embed on your process website **OR** 
*	an interactive data visualization and embed within your process website.

The timeline should:
* show a narrative timeline thread of influences, demonstrated over at least three iterations.
* demonstrate the framing of your story. How did this world come to be what it is?
* show evidence of your research, including secondary topics
* have your object somewhere within it


In other words, show the past history of this future, as well as where it's at currently.

The timeline should contain **at least** 3 iterations if not more.

Post the timeline to your Process site
