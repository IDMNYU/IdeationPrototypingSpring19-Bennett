### Future Project Week 3: Prototype + Refine Narrative

#### Due Noon April 21st (process site: final project):

- [Review the main assignment brief to ensure that you are within it.](future.md)

0. Do 2 more additional prototyping sessions on paper. For each spend on 10 minutes creating this prototype through sketching. Close your laptop. These prototypes are to be something in your future. They could be suggestions from the feedback session, something that has been in your mind, or iterations (with developments and refinements) of previous prototyping sessions. These sessions are meant to be free, experimental and fast. Let your mind run!

Post the outcome of the prototyping exercise. Evident on your site should be AT LEAST 4 prototypes. Write a reflection on what came out of it, that was unforseen. Also discuss where this goes next, which ones are you moving forward with and why.


1. Refine your chosen prototype with another iteration through a different medium/material. Refer to Module 9. Document your process. Post images with a reflection.


2. Post a draft of the [narrative timeline](narrative_timeline.md). Refine your research, seeking out new research as needed. No holes should be evident, and your story must make sense.


3. Ideate on possible delivery methods via a mind map. Your delivery methods should be diverse. Think about your future and what would be a fitting medium to describe this world. There should be a connection point between the content of your Future and the delivery method. Henceforth, ideate to uncover new possibilities. Post the map(s) and a reflection to your site.


### Future Project Week 2: Refine Idea + Research

#### Due Noon April 14th (process site: final project):

Get out of your laptop. Go to the library, book store, video bank, musuem, hear a talk, listen to the radio, read a newspaper, go deep into research journals!!


0. Post the outcome from the [Headlines From The Future Exercise](HeadlinesFromTheFuture.md). Reflect on the feedback given from class. What questions need to be resolved? What feedback was given?


1. Create an annotated bibliography with 8 different source topics. The annotation needs to detail how this source topic fits in as well as what this source provides. Why is this source useful?

	What are some analogous times in history? What are some related discoveries in science, technology, medicine, etc? Review your theme and descriptor cards in relation to your idea and expand upon them/develop new ones to see what to research in order to develop your idea + story.

	Do some mind mapping to help your explore how these intersect and expand your project.

	Review the questions and feedback from class.



2. Identify secondary topics related to your primary topic. Review your enabler cards. Remember that the enabler cards are meant to be what enables your world/situation to exist. Draw a mind map to help you see what to research and to explore.

	Add 8 more resources to your annotated bibliography, related to these secondary topics.




3. Develop a storyboard which describes this future and how it came to be. Think: high level and not day-to-day or the minutiae of character actions. This is the framing of your story/future.

	This storyboard MUST show evidence of your research through new developments, as well as the exercises done in class last week. This storyboard is a low-fi draft. Yet, quality work is expected. Take time to craft this for efficient communication.
