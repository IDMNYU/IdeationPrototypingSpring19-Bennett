### Future Project Week 2: Refine Idea + Research

#### Due Noon April 14th (process site: final project):

Get out of your laptop. Go to the library, book store, video bank, musuem, hear a talk, listen to the radio, read a newspaper, go deep into research journals!!


0. Post the outcome from the [Headlines From The Future Exercise](HeadlinesFromTheFuture.md). Reflect on the feedback given from class. What questions need to be resolved? What feedback was given?


1. Create an annotated bibliography with 8 different source topics. The annotation needs to detail how this source topic fits in as well as what this source provides. Why is this source useful?

	What are some analogous times in history? What are some related discoveries in science, technology, medicine, etc? Review your theme and descriptor cards in relation to your idea and expand upon them/develop new ones to see what to research in order to develop your idea + story.

	Do some mind mapping to help your explore how these intersect and expand your project.

	Review the questions and feedback from class.



2. Identify secondary topics related to your primary topic. Review your enabler cards. Remember that the enabler cards are meant to be what enables your world/situation to exist. Draw a mind map to help you see what to research and to explore.

	Add 8 more resources to your annotated bibliography, related to these secondary topics.




3. Develop a storyboard which describes this future and how it came to be. Think: high level and not day-to-day or the minutiae of character actions. This is the framing of your story/future.

	This storyboard MUST show evidence of your research through new developments, as well as the exercises done in class last week. This storyboard is a low-fi draft. Yet, quality work is expected. Take time to craft this for efficient communication.
