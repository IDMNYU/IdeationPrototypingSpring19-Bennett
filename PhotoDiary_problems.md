# Photo Diary


## Part 1:

Think about a problem you current face, or something that particularly challenges you.

This could be a certain aspect of your day. It could be something in your living space.

Take photos which describe this problem. Post them to your process site (under "homework" as "photo diary") and describe the problem/issue.

## Part 2:

Is there a particular problem or issue you see in your world that you would like to take a stab at resolving or to explore?

Perhaps it's an inefficiency or accessibility issue, or a societal trend in the wrong direction.

Describe it both in words and with visuals.
