# MidTerm Project

1. After the speed dating exercise, group your favorites of your classmate's topics from their Photo diary assignment. Decide which ones intrigue you. Which ones do you want to explore more deeply and develop a response to?

Choose one. You may choose your own, provided it does not soley involve you.


2. Before defining the problem, understand what it is through research:

* Collect information, go to the site, take pictures, conduct visual research, 

* What materials are currently used? What practices are currently available?

* Where does the current research on this topic stand? Find articles, publications, books, talks, movies, video, history of materials, demographic research, ethnographic research. 


3. Maps: Create a mind map, exploring the topic. Be specific and explicit. Do not be vague. We should be able to traverse the lines to get more specific and articulate.

With your findings from this mind map, dig deeper by developing a concept map. How are things related?

What do these maps help to crystalize? Post all of this information on your Process site


4. Define the problem. What is it? What aspects are common to it? What aspects are problematic? Write several paragraphs detailing your findings and understanding.


5. Collect more research. Design 4 surveys for 4 different level stakeholders and constituents. (See module 2 for different questions and ideas.) Ask open ended questions and listen. Don't just listen for what you want to hear. Conduct surveys of the site and participants. What is it like to be in their shoes (empathize with them)?

Offer prompts in an interview to uncover people's emotions about things that might not come up otherwise. Set yourself up for a more engaging conversation. A fill-in-the-blank exercise could focus on how your user would feel in a given context. 

For example:

I am ______ when I _______ because _________ and _________


Who else could you speak to, that is related to the topic, that could give you a fresh presepective? Post who these people are, along with drafts of your surveys.


6. Create an annotated bibliography with 5 different sources. The annotation needs to detail how this source fits in as well as what this source provides. Why is this source useful?


7. Create a draft of a dense mood board, visually exploring the project. Collect all of your visual research here. What sort of trends do you notice? Add more visual research exploring these findings. 

This should not be strictly be soley comprised of the literal instance of this problem. Rather, you need to explore it with a wider angle. 


8. Create a draft of a visual storyboard, detailing the action cycle of this problem/issue.
