# MidTerm Project

### Deliverables (post under "midterm" by noon on March 3rd)

* Develop visual research. Immerse yourself in the environment you are working in, to collect information:

1. Go to a physical location and sit there quietly for 30 minutes, making note of what you observe. Focus on your visual field, one spot at a time. Pay attention to details! How are people interacting? Notice facial expressions, gestures, and other nonverbal cues.
2. Write down your observations, starting with the words "I wonder" (e.g., I notice children in the market looking after their siblings; I wonder if this is typical?)
3. Take photographs of the materials, textures and objects you see around you. Notice what people gravitate to, what inspires them, and the colors, patterns, and objects that make this place.
4. Review your notes. What stands out? what have you leaned? What do you want to investigate more thorough interviews? Write a post reflecting on this.
5. Print out the photos and start to play with them. How might you manipulate these elements and incorporate them in the look and feel? Arrange them in different ways to reveal new textures and shapes. Post the results to your Process Site.

* Refine your surveys from the feedback you received in class. Do not constantly use a term or concept which you are exploring within your questioning. 

* If you need to execute a few of your surveys to assist you in refining your language and the focus of your project, do so. Write a reflection on your Process site as to what transpired, what did you learn, what has changed, and what your next steps are.

* Develop your Annotated Bibliography by diversifying and delving in much more deeply: Add 5 more sources from different research streams. (For example, if last week's were all web articles, look up video talks, radio programs, tv shows and/or books). All research needs to have a critical discourse and direct link to your project. Diversify your research. 

* Identify secondary topics related to your primary topic. For example, if you are investigating why student loans fall into delinquency, primary topics would include the students, the schools, and the jobs the get outside of college. Secondary topics would include banks, interest rates, government policies, the economic impact. 

Add 5 more resources to your annotated bibliography, related to these secondary topics.

* Draw a new concept map exploring this weeks findings. If you need, create another mind map, exploring your findings. Post it as well as a written reflection. 

* Conduct 6 surveys. Document your process and the findings. Write a blog post, reflecting on what transpired and what your next steps are. Do you need to conduct more surveys? Is there another audience that you need to speak with?


#### Project Launch in Week 3: (Previous assignment, kept here for record)

1. After the speed dating exercise, group your favorites of your classmate's topics from their Photo diary assignment. Decide which ones intrigue you. Which ones do you want to explore more deeply and develop a response to?

Choose one. You may choose your own, provided it does not soley involve you.


2. Before defining the problem, understand what it is through research:

* Collect information, go to the site, take pictures, conduct visual research, 

* What materials are currently used? What practices are currently available?

* Where does the current research on this topic stand? Find articles, publications, books, talks, movies, video, history of materials, demographic research, ethnographic research. 


3. Maps: Create a mind map, exploring the topic. Be specific and explicit. Do not be vague. We should be able to traverse the lines to get more specific and articulate.

With your findings from this mind map, dig deeper by developing a concept map. How are things related?

What do these maps help to crystalize? Post all of this information on your Process site


4. Define the problem. What is it? What aspects are common to it? What aspects are problematic? Write several paragraphs detailing your findings and understanding.


5. Collect more research. Design 4 surveys for 4 different level stakeholders and constituents. (See module 2 for different questions and ideas.) Ask open ended questions and listen. Don't just listen for what you want to hear. Conduct surveys of the site and participants. What is it like to be in their shoes (empathize with them)?

Offer prompts in an interview to uncover people's emotions about things that might not come up otherwise. Set yourself up for a more engaging conversation. A fill-in-the-blank exercise could focus on how your user would feel in a given context. 

For example:

I am ______ when I _______ because _________ and _________


Who else could you speak to, that is related to the topic, that could give you a fresh presepective? Post who these people are, along with drafts of your surveys.


6. Create an annotated bibliography with 5 different sources. The annotation needs to detail how this source fits in as well as what this source provides. Why is this source useful?


7. Create a draft of a dense mood board, visually exploring the project. Collect all of your visual research here. What sort of trends do you notice? Add more visual research exploring these findings. 

This should not be strictly/soley comprised of the literal instance of this problem. Rather, you need to explore it with a wider angle. 


8. Create a draft of a visual storyboard, detailing the action cycle of this problem/issue.
