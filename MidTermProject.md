# MidTerm Project

### Deliverables (post under "midterm" by noon on April 1st)

*Each of these is to be a polished, demonstrating a high level of craft, as well as detail that demonstrated your research, developments, and iterations:*

1. Finish the [Dating Profile](DatingProfile.md) of your product or service. 

2. Iterate your prototype, given your process thus far. If you want, develop a new prototype if you have new developments or leads.

3. Finish the [brochure or webpage](Brochure.md) of your product or service. This should include your refined prototype.


### Deliverables (post under "midterm" by noon on March 24th)

1. Think of something that you could make, relevant to your project. It does not have to emcompass your entire project. Perhaps it is an aspect of your project. For example, you are looking into body image through media. Perhaps you prototype a plug-in to translate images from the web, to be more realistic. Your prototype discusses and indicates how this works.

It can even be illogical, bad idea. For example, perhaps you are looking at how filter bubbles warp our perception. Perhaps you prototype a dome that goes over your modem, swapping out disparate viewpoints for ones that align with your perceptions.

These can be far-fetched, whimisical, futuristic, and wacky. The point is to be free to explore your project through different lenses. As well as to explore possible solutions.

Spend 10 minutes illustrating this prototype. Use paper and pencil. Snap images of this and post to your process site. Spend no more than ten minutes.

Repeat this process for a total of 10 prototypes.

These prototypes can (and should) be different aspects of your project. Some of them should be iterations of other prototypes. A few of these should be bad ideas, ie, things that help your problem grow and continue.



2. Prototype: Pick 1-2 of your physical prototypes developed in class, and refine them through additional iterations. Refine their visuals, purpose, function, useage. 

Consider 3-D printing them, or taking them into another material, such as wood, fabric, metal, plastics, etc. How does a different material change things? Does it change the experience? How so?

Visit the [Tandon Maker Center](http://makerspace.engineering.nyu.edu/) and check out details about [training here](http://makerspace.engineering.nyu.edu/training/)

If none of your prototypes have a physical form, develop refined high-level wireframes that describe the system and user experience.

Document your prototypes, process, construction, and any Maker Center activity. Post these to your site, along with a reflection on how your midterm project has developed or been impacted by this process. What has changed?


3. Storyboard: Develop your storyboard to show depth of topic, developments from the last iteration. Include your prototype. How does your story help to tell the tale of the problem, as well as the impact of your solution? Explore your solution through the narrative.

This story must show evidence of your research and secondary topics. Great strides from your last iteration are expected. 

High craft is expected here! There are many different ways to go about this. Find the one that works for you and *refine it*.

Use photos, artifacts, and media to create a story that follows a narrative arc-background, conflict, climax, and opportunities for resolution.



### Deliverables (post under "midterm" by noon on March 10th)

With ALL of the assigned research thus far completed, add to your research with the following:


1. Develop your research into the **secondary topics** that relate to your issue/problem. Switch up your research method. Hit the books and hit the talks/lectures. Add 5 more references to your annotated bibliography, discussing how each relates to your project and ADDS NEW VALUE.


2. Surveys: After an inital round of surveys, take what you've discovered and create 3 new surveys. Your questions should demonstrate a deeper understanding and investigation of your topic. Remember to design your questions so that they are not leading, nor communicating judgement. Be open. Have a classmate read over them and critique them.


3. Take the new surveys and get 10 new responses from participants that **are not** in the same demographic (ie, not your friends). Diversify your respondent population. 

At least 5 of these surveys must be completed in real time (not asynchronously). Having a conversation with someone allows you to pick up on so much more, than just the simple word. You can notice their body language, expression, and emotion. Make a mental note. An open dialog can uncover much more than a flat response to a question. Document the interview in an audio recording. Post them to your site.


4. Post about your new findings from your research and surveys. What did you find? How is your project developing? What goes into creating this situaion? Why do things happen this way?


5. Tell a Tale: With all of the above completed, it's now time to formulate a story about what your problem is, how it happens, what factors contribute to the issue (historical, economic, civic, political, governmental, social).

   Great storytellers-writers, filmmakers, designers-imbue empathy by translating characters' stories for others. It's a craft as old as time you can use to build empathy for the people you're designing for.

   * What is the story you want to tell? What did you learn during research that really inspired you? What is it about the daily challenges in someone's life? What are the forces that cause this problem? What are the effects? Tell the whole story. Write it out.

   * Storyboard this story. Recall what a storyboard is. Look back at module 4. Also check out the graphic novel, <a href = "https://law.duke.edu/musiccomic/download/">Theft! A History of Music</a>. You are communicating the major points to your story, not your story frame by frame. See the templates [here](https://github.com/IDMNYU/IdeationPrototypingSpring19-Bennett/tree/master/storyboardTemplates)

   Inherent in this is your visual language to tell the story. Think critically about the major points of your story and **HOW** to communicate this story.

   Look at your visual research materials. What can be developed more? What can be used? Do not use photos from a Google Image search. The materials must be from you directly in creation, construction, and composition.

   Use photos, artifacts, and media to create a story that follows a narrative arc-background, conflict, climax, and opportunities for resolution.

   * Post a storyboard draft. Post to your site with captions and a reflection.

   * Develop and iterate this storyboard draft to a much higher quality storyboard. The development and iteration should be noticible. Post to your site with captions and a reflection.



### Deliverables (post under "midterm" by noon on March 3rd)

* Develop visual research. Immerse yourself in the environment you are working in, to collect information:

1. Go to a physical location and sit there quietly for 30 minutes, making note of what you observe. Focus on your visual field, one spot at a time. Pay attention to details! How are people interacting? Notice facial expressions, gestures, and other nonverbal cues.
2. Write down your observations, starting with the words "I wonder" (e.g., I notice children in the market looking after their siblings; I wonder if this is typical?)
3. Take photographs of the materials, textures and objects you see around you. Notice what people gravitate to, what inspires them, and the colors, patterns, and objects that make this place.
4. Review your notes. What stands out? what have you leaned? What do you want to investigate more thorough interviews? Write a post reflecting on this.
5. Print out the photos and start to play with them. How might you manipulate these elements and incorporate them in the look and feel? Arrange them in different ways to reveal new textures and shapes. Post the results to your Process Site.

* Refine your surveys from the feedback you received in class. Do not constantly use a term or concept which you are exploring within your questioning. 

* If you need to execute a few of your surveys to assist you in refining your language and the focus of your project, do so. Write a reflection on your Process site as to what transpired, what did you learn, what has changed, and what your next steps are.

* Develop your Annotated Bibliography by diversifying and delving in much more deeply: Add 5 more sources from different research streams. (For example, if last week's were all web articles, look up video talks, radio programs, tv shows and/or books). All research needs to have a critical discourse and direct link to your project. Diversify your research. 

* Identify secondary topics related to your primary topic. For example, if you are investigating why student loans fall into delinquency, primary topics would include the students, the schools, and the jobs the get outside of college. Secondary topics would include banks, interest rates, government policies, the economic impact. 

Add 5 more resources to your annotated bibliography, related to these secondary topics.

* Draw a new concept map exploring this weeks findings. If you need, create another mind map, exploring your findings. Post it as well as a written reflection. 

* Conduct 6 surveys. Document your process and the findings. Write a blog post, reflecting on what transpired and what your next steps are. Do you need to conduct more surveys? Is there another audience that you need to speak with?


#### Project Launch in Week 3: (Previous assignment, kept here for record)

1. After the speed dating exercise, group your favorites of your classmate's topics from their Photo diary assignment. Decide which ones intrigue you. Which ones do you want to explore more deeply and develop a response to?

Choose one. You may choose your own, provided it does not soley involve you.


2. Before defining the problem, understand what it is through research:

* Collect information, go to the site, take pictures, conduct visual research, 

* What materials are currently used? What practices are currently available?

* Where does the current research on this topic stand? Find articles, publications, books, talks, movies, video, history of materials, demographic research, ethnographic research. 


3. Maps: Create a mind map, exploring the topic. Be specific and explicit. Do not be vague. We should be able to traverse the lines to get more specific and articulate.

With your findings from this mind map, dig deeper by developing a concept map. How are things related?

What do these maps help to crystalize? Post all of this information on your Process site


4. Define the problem. What is it? What aspects are common to it? What aspects are problematic? Write several paragraphs detailing your findings and understanding.


5. Collect more research. Design 4 surveys for 4 different level stakeholders and constituents. (See module 2 for different questions and ideas.) Ask open ended questions and listen. Don't just listen for what you want to hear. Conduct surveys of the site and participants. What is it like to be in their shoes (empathize with them)?

Offer prompts in an interview to uncover people's emotions about things that might not come up otherwise. Set yourself up for a more engaging conversation. A fill-in-the-blank exercise could focus on how your user would feel in a given context. 

For example:

I am ______ when I _______ because _________ and _________


Who else could you speak to, that is related to the topic, that could give you a fresh presepective? Post who these people are, along with drafts of your surveys.


6. Create an annotated bibliography with 5 different sources. The annotation needs to detail how this source fits in as well as what this source provides. Why is this source useful?


7. Create a draft of a dense mood board, visually exploring the project. Collect all of your visual research here. What sort of trends do you notice? Add more visual research exploring these findings. 

This should not be strictly/soley comprised of the literal instance of this problem. Rather, you need to explore it with a wider angle. 


8. Create a draft of a visual storyboard, detailing the action cycle of this problem/issue.
